# Xingu Entangled

Dive into the entangled lifeworld of Indigenous communities from the Amazon! Xingu Entangled offers a multi-layered experience of Indigenous material practices from the Upper Xingu region, where artifacts, stories, places, plants, animals, rituals, myths and events are uniquely interconnected. Rather than merely learning about physical objects, appreciate their complexity with the support of video clips and interactive networks. The visualized relationships carry deeply intertwined meanings. 

## How to use  
The videos show scenes from the Xingu, while the visualization displays elements appearing in the current scene and their interconnections in a diagram. As the scenes unfold, so do their associated diagrams by uncovering and highlighting elements. The interactivity allows you to break out of the default linear narrative and navigate between scenes, as well as learn more about specific elements and their wider contexts.

## Project
Xingu Entangled was created by the [Amazonia Future Lab](https://amazoniafuturelab.fh-potsdam.de), a transdisciplinary research project carried out 2021–2024 funded by the Digital Culture Programme of the German Federal Cultural Foundation and the Stiftung Humboldt Forum im Berliner Schloss. The interface was realized with the Wanderer, a web-based interface that links video footage with networks. The Wanderer is freely available as [open source software on GitHub](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/wanderer).
