wanderer instance: [uclab-potsdam.github.io/xingu-entangled](https://uclab-potsdam.github.io/xingu-entangled/)

## modes
the wanderer has three operating modes. you can switch between modes in settings.

- **live:** this is the public version, showing the data hosted on github
- **edit:** this is used for editing, all changes are local (i.e. they are saved in your browser).
  - entering the editing mode the first time creates a local copy of the live data.
  - if you already have a local copy (i.e. entered the editing mode before) your local changes will be restored. If instead you want to reset your local data to the live version and continue working on that click on _delete local changes_.
- **preview:** let's you preview your local changes.
